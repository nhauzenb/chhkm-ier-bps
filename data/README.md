### Data for the two empirical applications. 
In the first application, we combine predictive densities of GDP growth for the euro area (EA) produced by individual professional forecasters participating in the [ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/survey_of_professional_forecasters/html/index.en.html).  Second, we forecast US inflation using a set of autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) regression models. The second  For the different macroeconomic variables in the ADL regression, we rely on the popular FRED-QD dataset provided by the *Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis* and publicly available [here](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/). The folder [`data`](./data/) contains both datasets.
