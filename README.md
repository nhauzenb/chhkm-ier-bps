### Data for the two empirical applications. 
In the first application, we combine predictive densities of GDP growth for the euro area (EA) produced by individual professional forecasters participating in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) with the histograms for each forecaster in the panel publicly available [here](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/survey_of_professional_forecasters/html/all_data.en.html). In the second application, we forecast US inflation using a set of autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) regression models. For the different macroeconomic variables in the ADL regressions, we rely on the popular FRED-QD dataset provided by the *Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis* and publicly available [here](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/). The folder [`data`](./data/) contains ... .
